# WookieBox
## By Alek Aker and Ann Cerveny

WookieBox is a the first partnered project of the Mod 3 Front-End Engineering program at the Turing School of Software and Design. The premise of this project is to build an application that uses fetch to access the Swapi API (https://swapi.co/) and uses ReactJS to display the nested information into modular components. This was also an introduction into testing using Enzyme and Jest. Enjoy!

### Learning Objectives

ReactJS, JSX, TDD, Enzyme/Jest

### Setup

To run the application, first clone down this repo. Then, run `npm install`, followed by `npm start`, to initialize the on server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
